Here's an example VBA code that loops through all non-empty columns and for each cell in a column while any cell length is greater than **38** then reduces the column width by **5** until the column width is **35** and reduces row height by **5** until the row height is **15**:

```vba
Sub LoopThroughColumns()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim col As Range
    Dim cel As Range
    
    Set ws = ActiveSheet
    
    For Each col In ws.UsedRange.Columns
        If WorksheetFunction.CountA(col) > 0 Then
            For Each cel In col.Cells
                Do While cel.Value <> "" And Len(cel.Value) > 38 And col.ColumnWidth > 35 And cel.RowHeight > 15
                    col.ColumnWidth = col.ColumnWidth - 5
                    cel.RowHeight = cel.RowHeight - 5
                Loop
            Next cel
        End If
    Next col
End Sub
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
